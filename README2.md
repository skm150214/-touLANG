" tou" run rules:
-cycle:
 -checks for ptps(and teleports)
 -runs code (like moving pointer)
things from cycle:
 -pointer moves to ptp: ignores ptp
 -pointer moves trough ptp: ignores ptp
 -ptp teleports pointer to another ptp: ignores ptp that it got teleported to (and ignores it until the pointer moves to the idx
extra:
 -ptps are constants, so you cannot change them
